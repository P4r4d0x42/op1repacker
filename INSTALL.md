# Installation


## Mac OS X

First make sure you have Python 3 installed. To do that open launcher, find
terminal and launch it. In the terminal type `python3 --version` and press
enter. If you get something like `command not found` you'll need to install
python3 first.

### Install Python 3
*Skip this if you already have Python 3 installed*

1. Install Homebrew by running the following command in the terminal:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2. With Homebrew installed you can use it to install Python 3. Run the following
   command in the terminal:

    brew install python3

3. Python should now be installed.

## Install op1repacker

Run the following command (again in the terminal):

    pip3 install op1repacker

Verify that it runs by running the command `op1repacker --version`
(it should print it's version number)

## Windows
